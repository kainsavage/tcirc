/*
 * This is a sample database migration script. Scripts should be named like so:
 *
 *   <task number> <task title>.sql
 *
 * It should contain SQL to apply the change from the task.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *   ALTER TABLE foo ADD bar INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
 *
 * Do not include SQL to undo the change from the task unless your project likes
 * living dangerously.
 *
 * Do not modify any of these scripts once they have been pushed to the central
 * git repository. If you need to make additional SQL changes related to a
 * task, create a new task for that and put the changes in a new script file
 * named after that new task.
